# Selenium Web Testing
<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains my test cases and scripts for learning selenium in automated tests.

All tests were carried out on the 'The Internet ver. 0.58.0 ' 


In each folder there are test cases in xml format to be imported into TestLink and test cases in xls format.

I'm using Python 3.8, Selenium WebDriver and Pytest in this project.
